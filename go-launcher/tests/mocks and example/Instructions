The file contained LauncherInstalled.dat is taken from the path c:\ProgramData\Epic\UnrealEngineLauncher\LauncherInstalled.dat

Additional actions to find Installed Epic Games, Executables, and Building Launch Links are as following

1. Locate the Epic Games installation directory:
	 - On Linux (with Wine/Proton):
		 ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Epic Games/
	 - On Windows:
		 C:\Program Files\Epic Games\

2. Find the manifest files:
	 - Epic Games Launcher stores game info in .item or .manifest files, typically in:
		 C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests\
		 or
		 <WinePrefix>/drive_c/ProgramData/Epic/EpicGamesLauncher/Data/Manifests/
	 - These are JSON files containing game name, install location, and executable path.

3. Parse the manifest files:
	 - Read each manifest file and extract:
		 - InstallLocation
		 - LaunchExecutable
		 - AppName or DisplayName
	 - Example fields:
		 {
			 "InstallLocation": "C:/Program Files/Epic Games/GameFolder",
			 "LaunchExecutable": "Game.exe",
			 "AppName": "GameName"
		 }

4. Build the launch link:
	 - Epic Games uses a URI scheme:
		 com.epicgames.launcher://apps/<AppName>?action=launch&silent=true
	 - Example:
		 com.epicgames.launcher://apps/GameName?action=launch&silent=true

5. Automate with a script:
	 - Write a Go, Python, or Rust script to scan the manifest directory, parse JSON, and output the installed games with their launch links and executable paths.

Summary:
- Scan manifest files for installed games.
- Extract install location and executable.
- Build Epic Games Launcher URI for launching.
